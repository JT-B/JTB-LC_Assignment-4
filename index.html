             <p id=edu>After graduating high school I began attending the Missouri University of Science &amp Technology in Rolla MO. I initially went to the college to pursue an Engineering degree. After roughly a year at the school I switched my major to a degree in biology. Along the way I picked up a minor in history as it fit with many of the electives I was taking.</p>

            <p>My first major job out of college was at the bioMerieux manufacturing site in Hazelwood, Mo. At the site I worked in a lab that manufactured complex chemical media used in the Vitek 2 system. In the lab I carry out a number of different tasks from making bulk batches of growth media using 400L kettles to producing small batches of chemical intermediaries that are then delivered for further processing. I am also responsible for troubleshooting all of the equipment we use as well as training new hires. </p>
